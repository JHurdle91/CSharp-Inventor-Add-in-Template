	CSharp Add-In for Autodesk Inventor
	======================================

	This is a template for developing add-ins for Autodesk Inventor using CSharp.

	It is derived from Brian Ekins' "Nifty Add-In Template" found here:

	I've tweaked the template for my own use and converted it to C# using dotPeek by jetbrains found here:
